## Introduction

### Quic
Quic is a minimalistic social networking application built with the MERN stack that lets you instantly link up with people who are looking to partake in a similar activity as you.

### Setup
Here's how to get the application up and running. There's two parts to the setup (the code snippets below are to be typed into terminal sessions)

<li>Frontend</li>

```shell
> cd quic
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
This will get the React app up and running on the front end.

<li>Backend</li>

```shell
> cd quick/backend
$ npm i
$ nodemon server
```
  This will start the server on the backend and establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage.
  
### Use Cases
Some use cases of this application are
<li>Craving a bubble tea but all your friend(s) are "busy"? Find someone on Quic to grab a bubble tea with!</li>
  <li>Want to shoot some pool but all your friend(s) are "busy"? Find someone on Quic to play with!</li>
  <li>Want to...alright, you know the drill.</li>

## Scope of Improvement
<li>We could translate this to a phone application which will undoubtedly be more convenient to use</li>
